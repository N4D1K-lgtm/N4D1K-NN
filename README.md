The entire purpose of this is to show my friends that wont care

you'll have to install nnfs python module (Just run pip install nnfs)

I handwrote everything but the adam optimizer but almost none of it is my code, followed lots of youtube videos explaining everything and giving examples.
I plan on eventually parsing through the MNIST database and converting the 60,000 test images to 1D numpy arrays and training the AI on that.
GUI at one point???

You should read through the code and see if you could explain any of the super mathy parts I commented that I didn't understand

If you have questions I can explain almost everything (besides the stuff I specifically said I didn't understand)

The AI normally finishes around 90 % accuracy, I still need to mess with more iterations and see if that goes up. I've seen as high as 98% and as low as 75%

## Nate's Corollary
`pip install python-mnist`  
Go to `bin` and run:  
`./get_mnist_data.sh`
