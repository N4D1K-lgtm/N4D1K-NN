# Kidans-NN (with help from Nathaneal Frisch)

The entire purpose of this is to show my friends that wont care

I handwrote everything but the adam optimizer but almost none of it is my code, followed lots of youtube videos explaining everything and giving examples.

Heads up it literally takes 12 years to iterate through 60000 images 10000 times. (I might eventually figure out actual python libraries for NN's). Sorry in advance.

If you have questions I can explain almost everything (or can try to), besides the stuff I specifically said I didn't understand in code comments.

If you're dave, dont judge my code. If you're not dave... think whatever you like. Feel free to contribute to add to a branch or message me directly.

(nate wrote stuff for importing MNIST images)

If you want to mess with making your own NN with the classes/framework I used message me if you're stuck. (start by reading functions_and_classes.py)

GUI will eventually happen.

## Dependencies
`pip install python-MNIST`  
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
`pip install numpy`
Go to `bin` and run:  
`./get_mnist_data.sh`
